        <h2 className='law_title'>FAMILY LAW</h2>
        <p> The terms “Family Law,” “Divorce,” and “Matrimonial Law” are frequently used interchangeably. However, they are different. Family Law is a broad category that includes dissolution of marriage (divorce), parenting and non-parenting disputes involving children (unmarried parents or grandparents), adoption, pre-marital or cohabitation agreements, modification or enforcement of judgments, restraining orders, and the like.</p>

        <p>We provide exceptional legal services to clients in all areas of Colorado family law. We understand the sensitive nature of difficult family law matters, and are dedicated to maintaining privacy for our diverse clientele, including business executives, entrepreneurs, real estate developers & trust beneficiaries. We have established a reputation for resolving the most contentious and complex disputes with the utmost discretion.</p>

<h3 className='law_subtitle'>AN ENTIRE TEAM REPRESENTING YOU</h3>
<p>Our clients love knowing that Kalamaya | Goscha holds weekly meetings to discuss recent developments in domestic-relations law, their strategy in each case, and the experts and opposing counsel involved to ensure we provide top-notch service. If the lead attorney is in court or on vacation, we always have someone with experience in family law cases that is familiar with your matter and can step in.</p>

<p>For high asset divorces and more complex disputes, we frequently staff a partner, associate and paralegal on a case. We never bill for two attorneys working at the same time. The result is cost-savings for our clients because Elizabeth or Leanna take the lead on time-intensive things like discovery and drafting motions. Ryan, Amy, or Georgina is responsible for developing a strategic plan to best position the case for settlement and, if necessary, trial.</p>

 
<h3 className='law_subtitle'>EXPERIENCE MATTERS</h3>
<p>Ryan and Amy have extensive experience in family law involving high asset divorces, complex property valuations, trusts, mountain real estate, closely-held businesses and contested pre-marital agreements. They have both litigated cases involving marital estates with more than $10 million at issue.</p>

<p>Ryan and Amy have helped numerous families navigate parenting plans and complicated post-decree parenting time disputes. Georgina also has experience with a variety of child custody disputes. All attorneys at Kalamaya | Goscha have handled parental relocation cases.</p>
